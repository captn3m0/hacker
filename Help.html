<title>Hacker 2.9.04 Help</title>
</head><body>
<h2><center>Introduction</center></h2> Welcome to Hacker, a game built
completely by me(i.e Abhay Rana). Hacker is a game that allows the
player(you) to hack into servers of 9 companies and get money. Your aim
is to get as much money as you can within the stipulated 30 days. After
30 days, the game finishes.<hr>
<h3>How To Play</h3>
Hacker is a text based game, and you have to <i>type</i>
everything. A lot of people have asked me to convert it to a graphic
based game, but it seems fine to me in text. When you start the game,
you shall face such a screen:
<img src="Readme_files/welcome.jpg"><br>Soon the loading will be
completed and you shall be asked to enter a name. If you have saved
your game, Hacker shall allow you to load the game at this stage. The
Name entry screen looks like this. Type in anything you want.<br><br>
<tt>Enter Your Name :Nemo<br><br></tt>
After you enter the name, your Home Page shall be displayed, and this
is the center of all your hacking activities. This consists of 3 parts.
The first is the list of 9 servers you may hack into. The second is the
information part. Here you name , days spent and Cash is displayed. the
third is the text entry box, where you shall enter commands:
<img src="Readme_files/welcom2.jpg"><br>
<h4>Connect</h4><br>
The first command you will use is <b><tt>CONNECT</tt></b>. It (true to its name) is used to connect to a server. The syntax of the command is
<p><tt>CONNECT [Site Number]</tt></p><p>
So type in </p><p><tt><font color="green">CONNECT 2</font></tt></p><p> to connect to Amazon.com, and hit Enter.
</p><h4>Name And Password</h4>
After you connect to a site, you will face a welcome message from the site, asking for a user name and password:<br>
<img src="Readme_files/amazon.jpg"><br>At the name prompt, you can type
in the user name(if you are an employee of Amazon, or are a great
seer). If you somehow type the correct name, the site shall accept it.
But if you don't, which is the case over here, you should type in the
following command:
<p><tt><font color="green">PNAME</font></tt><font color="green"></font></p><p>PNAME
stands for ProgramName. As soon as you hit enter, the program shall go
through several permutations and combinations to hack into the name.
The program also, through a malicious code, increases the number of
attempts from 3 to 50, so the chances of hacking are increased.<br>After you enter the command, you shall face such a screen:<br>
<img src="Readme_files/ncrack.jpg"><br>
After you crack the name you shall be asked for a password. Here too the similar command, </p><p><tt><font color="green">PPASS</font></tt></p><p> will be used. Type in the command and stand back as you hack into the server.
</p><h3>Access Granted</h3>
After you correctly access the server, you shall face this screen:
<img src="Readme_files/pcrack.jpg"><br>At this stage you have gained
access to the server. Now you only have to hack the payment file. To
get the name of the Payment file, type in either <p><tt><font color="green">DIR</font></tt> or <tt><font color="green">LS</font></tt></p><p>
DIR is for Windows and DOS based systems, while LS works for UNIX and
LINUX. You may also clear the screen by using the good old <tt><font color="green">CLS</font></tt>
command. The directory structure of each server is different. There
will generally be 2 files, one with an extension of DBF(ie
DataBaseFile). It is this filename you will have to remember.
<br>On my PC, the DIR command, after the CLS command, loks like this:
<img src="Readme_files/dir.jpg">There are two files, and the one
important for us, is the employee.dbf file. Its name may be different
on your system, but remember the extension dbf. to edit a dbf file, you
need sql support, and fortunately we are provided with miniSQL.
</p><h4>miniSQL</h4>
type in <p><tt><font color="green">SQL </font></tt></p><p>at the screen, and you shall be taken to miniSQL. miniSQL, is really mini, and only uses commands that we shall use. <br>
The following commands are valid for miniSQL:<br><tt><font color="green">q </font></tt> to quit and go back to the previous screen<br><tt><font color="green">SELECT [field name] FROM [filename]</font></tt> to read the file<br><b>Note:</b><br> The Filename should be without the dbf extension. For e.g :<b>employee</b>, NOT employee.dbf<br> Try the command SELECT now. You shall face such a listing:
<img src="Readme_files/select.jpg"><br>The amount range from $227 to
$3660 in our case. Try to be within these limits when you hack, since
the system operator shall notice, if a check goes out for
$20000.Fortunately there is a better way of guessing the amount. Type
in <tt><br><font color="green">SELECT AVG FROM [Filename]</font><br></tt>
The filename will be employee in our case(not employee.dbf). This
command calculates the avg of all checks sent, and displays it.<img src="Readme_files/avg.jpg"><br>So
now we know that we have to get ourselves a check of around $1337 to
toe the line. Let us get us $1400 as a round figure. To insert a record
into a table in SQL, we use the INSERT command. Type in <tt><br><font color="green">INSERT INTO [Filename] </font><br></tt>and you will face this:<br>
<img src="Readme_files/insert.jpg"><br>The new a/c could be in any
name. But the a/m should be near the average that you get using the
earlier command. The server, supposedly, notices only payments that are
way below or above the average. So now that you have hacked, quitely
slip off the server. First exit SQL by typing <tt>'q'</tt> at the prompt. Then get out from the server by typing 
<tt><br><font color="green">EXIT</font></tt><font color="green"> or <tt><font color="green">QUIT</font><br></tt></font>
You shall get back to the home page. The amout shall be increased, and you shall have spent a day.
<br>
If you do not want to play the entire game in one sitting, type in 
<tt><br><font color="green">SAVE </font></tt> at the home screen to save the game. When you restart, you shall be allowed the option of restoring it from where you left it.
